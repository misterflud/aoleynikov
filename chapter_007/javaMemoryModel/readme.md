# Java Memory Model


## Task

Explain Race Condition and problem Visibility in concurrent in Java.


## Technology
 	


## Structure

-	main.java.ru.job4j
	+ 	controller
		+	RaceConditions.java
		+	Visibility.java

		
## Realisation


 
## Notes

Race Condition means that we don't know exactly result of operation. It is random.
Problem Visibility in concurrent is based on easy thing. If we change something in  thread this changes can be invisible for other threads.
(if we don't use volatile, sync in right way).
