# CRUD3


## Task

Create CRUD in web page:
- 	Create
- 	Read
- 	Update
- 	Delete

The main difference with CRUD, CRUD2 is using Spring Framework. Maybe it will be different in design views and business logic.

## Realisation

25.02.2018
I deleted all files and created new controller (jsp are stayed). After that I started project on server and it has worked still.
Start url: http://localhost:8080/crud3/users.do
The next steps is project without web.xml.
 
## Notes

Spring is very useful framework, but it's not the spherical horse in vacum. Programmer should do a lot of work with environments (IDE, maven, servers etc). 
I wasted time to solve 6 error in Eclipse, some errors creates when web.xml has mistakes, but IDE doesn't show where exactly problem, some errors are solved restart IDE. When you adds new server (tomcat) 
Eclipse does't adds files in workspace folder "Server" and id creates errors when project will deploy -- solve is deletes server and adds again.
