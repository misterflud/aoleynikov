# Chapter_005 Ð¡ollections


## Description

This chapter is about collections. 
Here I used collections for some interesting projects and I created self realisation of collections (FIFO, LIFO, ArrayList, LinkedList, Map, Tree).


## Main Technology

- Lists.
- External sorting.

## Structure

Some maven projects contains a lot of tasks. Reads readme.md for getting more information. 

- collection_framework.
- generalization.
- generic. 
- iterator. Here I created iterator and used it for sorting, conversion, etc arrays. Interesting.
- list. It contains my dynamic arrays (linked and array lists). I compared with JDK array realisation. Interesting task.
- map. It contains my Hashmap. Interesting task.
- sort.
- taskOne. Big task. Manages bank accounts. Uses JDK Map and ArrayList with pattern Strategy. Interesting task.
- taskTwo. Big task. Program should create Order Books according to orders from XML file (very big file 500 Mb). Two actions supported: new order, delete exiting order. And after processing the whole file, print to standard output all order books generated. It should work and work fast. I used external sorting. Interesting task.
- tree. It contains my Tree. Interesting task.
- taskThree.
